# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Resourcely

## What is Resourcely?

Resourcely is your **paved road** to secure, efficient, and easy-to-manage cloud infrastructure. We take a proactive approach to preventing security breaches caused by misconfiguration and enhancing developer productivity.

In modern software development, developers have to focus not only on developing the application logic, but also on creating, configuring, and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. This not only slows down development but increases user error which can lead to [security breaches caused by misconfiguration.](https://www.resourcely.io/post/reducing-the-risk-of-infrastructure-misconfiguration-with-resourcely)

Resourcely is a paved road for infrastructure, meaning it guides you through creating secure and compliant cloud infrastructure without the need to understand the vast amount of configuration options. With Resourcely you can:

* Leverage secure-by-default resource templates to prevent misconfiguration from the start
* Block resource provision requests that don't adhere to configured guardrails
* Make infrastructure management easy, allowing developers to focus more on development and less on cloud complexity
* Track the creators and statuses of resource pull requests from one interface, reducing context switching and supporting audit requirements
